# Password-Generator
This project is a HTML, CSS and Javascritp Application to generate random passwords.

This project is a Bootcamp Javascript homework assignment.  I was hoping to build something interesting with Javascript.  I know it is smart to have a strong password for social media accounts, banking, shopping and more.  

Functionalities:

1- Generating a Password:
* The user must know if they want to use Uppercase/Lowercase letters, Numbers or Symbols.   
* The user then enters the desired length of the password.  No less than 4 and no more that 20 characters.
* A password alphabetic, numeric, symbol or a mix of them all is generated according to the choices of the user
* Depending on the length random characters from the password alphabet are selected and put back to back to form a totally random string according to the user's needs
* The randomly generated password is then displayed on the console

2- Checking a Password's Strength:

The Strength check is based on the following criteria:
* The password uses Uppercase Letters
* The password uses Lowercase Letters
* The password uses Numbers
* The password uses Symbols
* The length of the password is 4 or more
* If the length of the password is 16 or more is considered to be the minimum length for good password.
